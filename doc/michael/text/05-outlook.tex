\section{Outlook}

All gestures used in MagicVR are drawn in a plane.
It is possible to define gestures that are not in a plane, but the movement would be harder to explain to a user.
The symbols on the elemental stones shows the 2D trajectory that should be drawn in 3D space.
A visualization of a 3D trajectory would require another user guidance.
Our idea is a little fairy which gives hints about interaction possibilities and demonstrates according gestures by flying them in front of the user.

There are unlimited possibilities to define more gestures that interact with the scene.
For example, a gesture could trigger different actions dependent on the position and orientation it is drawn.
If you do a gesture in front of an object you could trigger an interaction on the object.
One idea is to let an object (for example the lantern fly) if you do a wind gesture in front of it.
