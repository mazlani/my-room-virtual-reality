\section{Outlook}

The implemented animation framework makes it easy to implement further animation types and more complex movements while they stay very control- and adjustable. There are multiple further ways how and where this animation framework could be applied e.g. animating not only Vectors but also materials, colors, transparency etc.\\

Since there wasn\rq{}t enough time to finish all our ideas, the interactions for lightning and wind bubbles was not completely implemented. Hitting the lantern with lightning bubbles should have lit up the scene bit by bit as if the light was trapped inside the lantern. The wind gesture should have activated a kind of manipulation mode in combination with a second gesture setting a direction. With this combination it should have been possible to move the lantern around in the scene in order to light up different parts of the scene.\\

Also because of the lack of time there was no opportunity to implement a better user guidance. Our idea would have been to implement a little fairy which gives hints about interaction possibilities and demonstrates according gestures by flying them in front of the user.
