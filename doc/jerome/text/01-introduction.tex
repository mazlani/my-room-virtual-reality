In this documentation the concept and implementation of MagicVR will be explained. MagicVR is a virtual reality application which was developed in c++ and OpenSG in order to run in the V2C mixed reality cave of the LRZ in Garching, Munich. It\rq{}s main feature is a 3D-Gesture-Recognition opening a whole world of interaction possibilities using only the wand (or any tracker) in a 3D tracking system. A lot effort also was put in the front-end of MagicVR using FractTime-Animations to easely define and control effects and movements within the virtual reality scene.
